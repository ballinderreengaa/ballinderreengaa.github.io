## Details
This repsoitory was setup to create an alternative to the Blogger website that is currently being used.

This was setup to make use of Jekyll support on GitHub Pages which creates a static HTML website that can be seen at https://ballinderreengaa.github.io

## Why Use GitHub Pages
[Blogger](https://blogger.com) is a useful blogging platform that is attached to the Google account used for club communications. It is free, robust and maintained by one of the largest companies in the world, Google.

Blogger lacks revision history so changes to entries are not tracked. This means that a post can be updated in the future and there would be no record of the change.

Using GitHub Pages helps by adding a history of check ins that people can view.

## Adding a New Post
A post can be added by creating a new file under the `_posts` folder. The naming convention is 'YYYY-MM-DD-PostName.extension'.
