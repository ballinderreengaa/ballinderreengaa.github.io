## South Galway Bay Music Festival

Our 2025 Music Festival runs from Friday July 11th, to Sunday July 13th and tickets are now available at https://southgalwaybaymusicfestival.ie

This is Ballinderreen Hurling and Camogie Club’s main fundraiser for 2025. This fundraiser is **separate from our development projects**, which are already fully funded. The Music Festival fundraiser is to **meet the day to day cost** of running our Club in 2025. In 2024, it cost approximately €110,000 to run our Hurling and Camogie clubs and the associated facility costs. Without the €30,000 profit from the 2024 Music Festival, our 2024 finances would have run at a deficit.

We hope the Ballinderreen Community will support this fundraiser by **buying a weekend ticket**. To thank our community, we’re offering a **discounted weekend ticket**. Use code BDN25 to reduce the **Weekend Ticket price from €66.13 to €54** (including fees). The discount code expires on 30th June. That’s three nights for the price of two! Children under 14 are €5 (including fees) and their ticket can only be bought as an add on to an adult ticket. This ensures children can only attend when accompanied by an adult and ensures we are compliant from an insurance perspective. 

Thank you for your continued support towards our Hurling and Camogie Club.
